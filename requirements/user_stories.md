## User Stories

User stories aids us in defining the value of Gestro's functionality, gaining a better grasp of why users desire a specific feature.

Furthermore, user stories are the building blocks upon which we build Gestro. It also serves as a reminder of the core of the project while allowing us to track progress and development of the project.

Here are some user stories which covers circumstances and use cases where Gestro would be useful in.
