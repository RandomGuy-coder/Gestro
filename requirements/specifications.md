## Specifications

Here are some of the main requirements for Gestro which were identified at the start of the project:

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-Time Operation - The program must run in real-time with sufficiently low latency. |
| Graphical User Interface (GUI) - The interface must be graphical so that users are able to easily see what is being captured from their webcam. |
| Customisable Features - The program must allow users to select and deselect features they would like to use. |
| Adaptability - The program must be able to be automatically calibrated to be used in different environment (Eg. different background, etc). |
| Manual Calibration - The program must allow the users to manually calibrate to be used in their environment to account for situations where the automatic calibration has failed. |
| Log - The program must include a log of operations that have been successfully called so that users can keep track of whether an operation is successful or not. |
| Practicality - The program must be able to work correctly with default out-of-the-box settings which requires minimal configuration to account for users not experienced with modern devices. |
| Ease of use - Some basic instructions should be provided in the program so that users can easily refer to it to learn how to use the program. |
